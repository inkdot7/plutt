# plutt


A scriptable plotting utility tailored for nuclear physics experiments.

# What's the idea?

Example 1: An event stream from a detector outfitted with e.g. scintillator
paddles or silicon segments that are read out on both ends. What's an easy way
to plot this?

Example 2: Another such detector rotated by 90 degrees. How hard can/should it
be to draw one vs the other in a Y-vs-X plot?

The ROOT prompt, as powerful as it is, has its limitations, for example when
dealing with zero-suppressed or multi-hit arrays.

Here's some human-readable pseudo-code for Example 1:

```
- Get array for left side -> "left"
- Get array for right side -> "right"
- Match channels between "left" and "right" -> "left2" and "right2"
- Plot "right2" vs "left2"
```

Typical pseudo-C++ & ROOT could be:

```c
// Init.
auto h1 = new TH1F(name, title, bins_x, min_x, max_x, ...);
auto left_handle = Input.GetHandle("MY_DET_LEFT");
auto right_handle = Input.GetHandle("MY_DET_RIGHT");

// For each event.
auto left = Input.GetData(left_handle);
auto right = Input.GetData(right_handle);
size_t l_i = 0;
size_t r_i = 0;
while (l_i < left->size() && r_i < right->size()) {
	auto l_ch = left[l_i]->channel;
	auto r_ch = right[r_i]->channel;
	if (l_ch == r_ch) {
		h1->Fill(l_ch);
	} else if (l_ch < r_ch) ++l_i;
	} else ++r_i;
}
```

To solve Example 2, we copy and adjust. And we copy-pasta all of that for every
detector, refactor, add calibration and complicate the logic states, build,
debug, ignore warnings, fight with git or copy between accounts or forget the
code ever existed... At least that is how it looks during hectic preparation
and beam-time debugging.

Equally bad, new data may not fit expected histogram limits, and a faulty
detector or mismatched accelerator setting is caught very late. Monitoring
should show everything that is going on, even if we don't think we want it.

Plutt tries to implement the human-readable version via scripting:

```c
l = MY_DET_LEFT
r = MY_DET_RIGHT
matched_l, matched_r = match_index(l, r)
hist("My detector hit-pattern", matched_l:id)
```

Now, don't forget that computers don't have brains! Don't put yours on the
shelf just yet, there's a couple of things to go through!


# Building

Suggested packages (Debian):

```
ccache -- Speed up recompiles.
libnlopt-dev -- Fitting.
libsdl2-dev -- Fast graphics.
```

Other software:

```
root -- ROOT files input and THttpServer.
ucesb -- UCESB input.
```
Note that ROOT must be built with the HTTP server support to use the web-page
renderer.

To compile:

```bash
make -jN
./plutt
```

**make** builds a version based on the compiler and build mode, e.g. **debug** or
**release**.

**plutt** is a script that chooses the binary the same way the Makefile chooses
the build directory.

The usual environment variables are available to steer the build as needed,
e.g. **CPPFLAGS**, **CFLAGS**, **LDFLAGS**, and **LIBS**.


# Running

```bash
./plutt -f myconf.plutt -r mytree myfile1.root myfile2.root
```

Loads script **myconf.plutt**, and read the tree named **mytree** from the two
ROOT files. A default GUI will be chosen depending on what's built in.

```bash
./plutt -f myconf.plutt -g sdl -u ../upexps/myunp/myunp --stream=localhost
```

The **myunp** unpacker will read event-data from a stream server on the
localhost, and provide UCESB structures to plutt. The GUI will always be the
SDL2-driven ImPlutt and must be built in.

```bash
# On host 192.168.1.1:
./plutt -f myconf.plutt -u ../ucesb/hbook/struct_writer 192.168.1.2
# On host 192.168.1.2:
../upexps/myunp/myunp --stream=event-builder-host --ntuple=RAW,SERVER,dummy
```

The unpacker will send UCESB structures to plutt over local network.

```bash
./plutt -f myconf.plutt -g sdl -g root:8100 -r myfiles...root
```

Both the ImPlutt and THttpServer GUI's will start, the latter will be available
on port 8100.


# GUI's

There are currently two GUI's available, depending on built-in support:

1. If SDL2 and FreeType2 are available via pkg-config, the low-latency
client-side ImPlutt plotting will be built.

2. If root-config is available, ROOT file and THttpServer support will be
built, depending on the ROOT build.

The default GUI is chosen from top to bottom from the above list.


## ImPlutt GUI

The ImPlutt GUI was started a long time ago when the ROOT GUI was rather
archaic for modern users. ROOT has gained a lot of QoL features since, but the
ImPlutt GUI offers very fast and specially made navigation, and large
modifications to the UI are much easier.

- Scroll-wheel in a plot:
	- Zoom around the pointer in **X** and **Y**.

- Scroll-wheel on an axis:
	- Zoom around the pointer in either **X** or **Y**.

- Click-drag-release pointer in a plot:
	- The selected area will be zoomed in, unless it's smaller than 5x5
	pixels which is typically a mis-click.

- Click-drag-release pointer on an axis:
	- The selected range will be zoomed in, again with a 5 pixel limit.

- Pressing **c**:
	- Starts cut creation mode.
	- Click in the graph to add a vertex to the cut polygon.
	- Press **Enter** to write the cut polygon to file, see the cmd-line
	  for written filename.
	- Press **Backspace** to remove the last point.
	- Press **Escape** to abort the cut.

- Pressing **l**:
	- Toggle logarithic counts state.

- Pressing **u**:
	- Unzoom **X** and **Y** completely.

- Pressing **x**/**y**:
	- Starts **X/Y** projection view, at most one per plot.
	- **w** in the original plot to increment the projection width.
	- **s** to decrement.
	- It's possible to zoom the projected plot, but the other features of
	  the main window plots are disabled.

- Pressing **shift+x**:
	- Clears the histogram under the pointer, including statistics and data
	  ranges.


## ROOT GUI

Opens a THttpServer on port 8080 by default, direct your web-brower to the
address **localhost:8080**. To run on e.g. port 10000, invoke the GUI like
**-g root:10000** on the command line.


# Let's define the data

It is important to understand the internal event data structure before
operating on them.

In principle, plutt bundles ID's (e.g. channel indices) and values into
**signals**, which have two important parts:
1. A list of ID's which have data.
2. A list of values for the ID's.

To be more detailed, a signal looks pretty much like:

```c
struct {
    vector<uint32_t> id;  // List of ID's with data, -1 means "no ID".
    vector<uint32_t> end; // End-offsets into the "value" vector for each ID.
    vector<Scalar>   v;   // All values over all ID's.
};
```

For example, 1 hit (v1) in id=2 and 2 hits (v2, v3) in id=5 looks like:

```c
id  = [2, 5]
end = [1, 3]
v   = [v1, v2, v3]
```

With a UCESB unpacker input, plutt creates signals based on typical suffixes,
unless the user has exactly configured a signal. Other input types, such as
EGMW and ROOT, are very flexible and is expected to be always be defined by the
user.

For example, given "MYDET":

```
Multi-hit zero-suppressed ucesb style:
	MYDETM
	MYDETMI
	MYDETME
	MYDET
	MYDETv
	-> MYDETMI used as ID's,
	   MYDETME used as value offsets,
	   MYDETv used as values
Can be explicitly defined with:
	MYDET = signal(MYDETMI, MYDETME, MYDETv)

Single-hit zero-suppressed ucesb style:
	MYDET
	MYDETI
	MYDETv
	-> MYDETI used as ID's,
	   MYDETv used as values
Can be explicitly defined with:
	MYDET = signal(MYDETI, MYDETv)

egmw-style:
	MYDET = signal(MYDET_id, MYDET_adc_a)

Typical ROOT-style:
	MYDET = signal(MYDET.my_ch, MYDET.my_value)

Scalar ucesb style:
	MYDET
	-> No ID,
	   MYDET used as value
```


# Grammar and syntax
```
signal[i]

	Creates a new signal from the i:th entry if it exists, and only the
	first value, e.g.:
		signal.id  = [1, 2]             [2]
		signal.end = [1, 2]   -> [1] -> [1]
		signal.v   = [v1, v2]           [v2]
		                                []
		                         [2] -> []
		                                []
signal[i][j]

	Creates a new signal from the i:th entry and the j:th value if it
	exists, e.g.:
		signal.id  = [1, 2]                            [2]
		signal.end = [2, 4]               -> [1][0] -> [1]
		signal.v   = [v11, v12, v21, v22]              [v21]
		                                               []
		                                     [1][2] -> []
		                                               []
signal:id

	Creates a new signal with the ID's as values:
		id = [-1]
		end = [length(signal.id)]
		v = signal.id
signal:v

	Creates a new signal without any ID's:
		id = [-1]
		end = [length(signal.id)]
		v = signal.v
```

```
a = signal(id-name, value-name)

	Creates a signal where the ID's are given by one source and the values
	by another. Note that the sources must have the same lengths!

	Example:
		my_id    = [3, 5]        a:id  = [3, 5]
		my_value = [100, 123] => a:end = [1, 2]
		                         a:v   = [100, 123]
a = signal(id-name, end-name, value-name)

	Creates a signal like above, but also with end offsets into the value
	array.

	Example:
		my_id    = [2, 4]       => a:id  = [3, 4]
		my_end   = [2, 4]          a:end = [2, 4]
		my_value = [1, 2, 3, 4]    a:v   = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

```
a = merge(b[, ...])

	Creates a signal where the given signals are merged in id order.

	Example:
		a = merge(b, c)
		b.id =  [1, 2]
		b.end = [1, 2]      a.id  = [1, 2, 3]
		b.v   = [b1, b2] => a.end = [2, 3, 4]
		c.id =  [1, 3]      a.v   = [b1, c1, b2, c2]
		c.end = [1, 2]
		c.v   = [c1, c2]
```

```
y = f(x)

	Chainable mathematical operations are available with signals and
	constants, which acts on each value individually in a scalar or array.
	Currently supported operations:
		(x)
		x+y
		x-y
		x*y
		x/y
		-x
		cos(x)
		sin(x)
		tan(x)
		acos(x)
		asin(x)
		atan(x)
		atan2(x, y)
		sqrt(x)
		exp(x)
		log(x)
		abs(x)
		pow(x, y)
```

```
cut(path)

	"path" points to a file which has a histogram title and an x/y pair
	per line which makes a cutting polygon:

		My histo
		0, 0
		10, 0
		0, 10
		10, 10

cut(histogram-name, (x,y)...)

	This is the inline version of the previous syntax, so the same example
	would look like:
		cut("My histo", (0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (10,10))
```

```
a = fit(b[, ...])

	This is a 'static' linear fit y=Ax+B of 2D points. The list of
	arguments consists of pairs (y, x), and 'a' will refer to this linear
	fit.

	Example:
		my_calib = fit((1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 3))

	This will fit a linear function through the three points, which can be
	used to scale histogram axes.
```

```
hist(title, x [, args])

	Draws a histogram of the values in x:v, with the given title.
	The optional arguments can be:
		logy
			Logarithmic counts.
		binsx=n
			# horizontal bins.
		contoured/filled
			Bin drawing style.
		transformx=name
			Reference to a static fit, see 'fit' above. This will
			scale the X axis, i.e. 'x' will be transformed by the
			linear fit y=Ax+B and the histogram is filled with the
			'y' values.
		fit("method"[,l,r])
			'method' can be any of:
				gauss
				exp+gauss
			l and r give the range to fit (omit: entire histogram).
		cut(cut-args)
			This histogram processes the current event only if the
			given cut has seen a hit. For more info about the cut
			syntax, see above.
		drop_stats=n time-unit
			Drops old data statistics, used to size histogram
			extents, that is older than about n time-units;
			s or min.
			Note that it doesn't drop histogram counts, it drops
			knowledge of min/max values to auto-fit ranges, and
			parts of the histogram counts can disappear if they go
			outside the auto-fitted range.
		drop_counts(n time-unit [, m # slices])
			Drops old counts. This can get expensive, use with
			care!
			When enabled, the histogram has 'm' slices in time
			(default 3) that are accumulated for presentation.
			Each slice holds counts during the given time, i.e.
			time=10 min and slices=5 means the histogram will keep
			data for 40-50 min.
			Only one slice is active for filling, and after the
			given time the slices are rotated and the oldest one
			is emptied.

		NOTE: Only one of drop_stats or drop_counts can be active,
		because reasoning about the combo seems like a waste of time!
		Also, drop_stats is a lot cheaper.
```

```
hist2d(title, y, x [, args])

	Histograms 'y:v' vs 'x:v', pairing up the n:th entry in both vectors,
	until either vector is exhausted.
	The arguments are similar to "hist", except:
		logy
			Does not exist.
		logz
			Logarithmic count coloring.
		binsy=n
			# vertical bins.
		transformy=name
			Transforms the 'y' entries.
		fit
			Does not exist.
		single[=n time-unit]
			Clear the histogram for every new fill, but keep a fill
			for the given time, default=0 s.
```

```
annular(title, r, r_limits, phi, phi_ref)

	Draw an annular histogram of the values r:v and phi:v, with the given
	title.
	r_limits = (r_min, r_max)
		This option maps r:v to min_r..max_r.
	phi_ref = [+-]angle
		Maps phi:v to phi angles, where 0 points to the right and
		positive values are counter clockwise.
```

```
b = bitfield(a1, n1, ..., aN, nN)

	Combines signals of given bit-widths into one value. The (ai,ni) pairs
	are combined in ascending order, ie the first pair becomes the least
	significant bits. Non-existent values are treated as 0.

		a1:id  = [1, 2]
		a1:end = [1, 2]
		a1:v   = [1, 2]     b:id  = [1, 2, 3]
		n1 = 8           => b:end = [2, 3, 4]
		a2:id  = [1, 3]     b:v   = [0x301, 0x400, 0x002, 0x500]
		a2:end = [2, 3]
		a2:v   = [3, 4, 5]
		n2 = 8
```

```
b = cluster(a)
b, c = cluster(a)

	Makes clusters of 'a', ie large neighbouring entries wrt to a:id are
	grouped. 'b:id' = a:id's weighted and floored, 'b:v' = sum, and the
	optional 'c:v' is the eta function, ie the centroid within the cluster.

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3, 5]    b:id  = [2, 5]
		a:end = [1, 2, 3, 4] => b:end = [1, 2]
		a:v   = [4, 5, 6, 7]    b:v   = [15, 7]
		                        c:id  = [2, 5]
		                        c:end = [1, 2]
		                        c:v   = [0, 0.45]
```

```
d = coarse_fine(a, b, c)

	Does on-the-fly fine-time calibration. 'a' = coarse times, 'b' = fine
	times, and 'c' is either a module type identifier or a number for the
	clock period. Identifiers could be 'vftx2', 'tamex3' etc, and c=1e-8
	would be interpreted as each clock cycle taking 10 ns.
	This example relies on previous data for the calibration, let's assume
	a uniform fine-time distribution between 100 and 600 ch:

		a:id  = [1, 2]
		a:end = [1, 2]
		a:v   = [10, 20]      d:id  = [1, 2]
		b:id  = [1, 2]     => d:end = [1, 2]
		b:end = [1, 2]        d:v   = [5001, 10003]
		b:v   = [200, 400]
		c = 'vftx2'
```

```
a = cut(cut-args)
a, b = cut(cut-args)

	Extracts entries in a hist/hist2d that pass the cut. 'a' will contain
	the x values and 'b' the y values. For more info about the cut syntax,
	see above.
```

```
filter_range([a <= b < c|a == b|b == c] [, ...], (d = e)...)

	For each entry where the conditions in the initial list of
	conditions are met, all the assignments are performed.
	A condition can be for a range or equality.

	Note that 'b' and 'e' must have the exact same layout, ie
	b:id === e:id and b:end === e:end!

		a = 1
		b:id  = [1, 3]
		b:end = [1, 3]       d:id  = [1, 3]
		b:v   = [1, 2, 3] => d:end = [1, 2]
		c = 3                d:v   = [4, 5]
		e:id  = [1, 3]
		e:end = [1, 3]
		e:v   = [4, 5, 6]

d = filter_range([a <= b < c|a == b|b == c] [, ...], e)

	Same as the previous, but with only one assignment.

	Note: with the same condition, the previous is more efficient.
```

```
b = length(a)

	Returns length of 'a:v':

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3]       b:id  = [0]
		a:end = [1, 2, 4]    => b:end = [1]
		a:v   = [1, 2, 3, 4]    b:v   = [4]
```

```
c, d = match_index(a, b)

	Cuts un-matched entries between 'a:id' and 'b:id':

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3]    c:id  = [2]
		a:end = [1, 2, 3]    c:end = [1]
		a:v   = [1, 2, 3] => c:v   = [2]
		b:id  = [2, 4]       d:id  = [2]
		b:end = [1, 2]       d:end = [1]
		b:v   = [4, 5]       d:v   = [4]
c, d = match_value(a, b, c)

	Cuts un-matched entries between 'a:v' and 'b:v' for each matched
	channel. A match means a:id[mi]==b:id[mj] && fabs(a:v[vi]-b:v[vj])<c.

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3]       c:id  = [2]
		a:end = [1, 2, 3]       c:end = [1]
		a:v   = [10, 20, 30] => c:v   = [20]
		b:id  = [2, 3]          d:id  = [2]
		b:end = [1, 2]          d:end = [1]
		b:v   = [21, 32]        d:v   = [21]
		c = 2
```

```
b = max(a)

	Returns the single largest entry in 'a:v':

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3]    b:id  = [2]
		a:end = [1, 2, 3] => b:end = [1]
		a:v   = [1, 3, 2]    b:v   = [3]
```

```
b = mean_arith(a)

	Calcs arithmetic mean over all 'a:id' for each entry in 'a:v':

		a:id  = [1, 2, 3]          b:id  = [0]
		a:end = [2, 4, 5]       => b:end = [2]
		a:v   = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    b:v   = [(1+3+5)/3, (2+4)/2]

c = mean_arith(a, b)

	Calcs arithmetic mean between the two signals for every '*:id' and
	'*:v':

		a:id  = [1, 2]
		a:end = [1, 3]       c:id  = [1, 2, 3]
		a:v   = [1, 2, 3] => c:end = [1, 2, 4]
		b:id  = [2, 3]       c:v   = [1/1, (2+4)/2, 3/1, 5/1]
		b:end = [1, 2]
		b:v   = [4, 5]
```

```
b = mean_geom(a)
c = mean_geom(a, b)

	Same as mean_arith except does (v_1 + ... + v_n)^(1/n).
```

```
c, d = pedestal(a, b [, args])

	Calculates pedestals of 'a' on-the-fly and cuts "a:v < std * b".
	'args' can be:
		tpat=a
		If 'a:v[0]' is non-zero, the pedestal statistics are updated,
		otherwise they are only applied.
	'c' will contain the cut values, and 'd' the standard deviations.
```

```
d = select_index(a, b)
d = select_index(a, b--c)

	Selects only 'a:id == b', or 'a:id' in the range [b,c]:
		a:id  = [1, 2]          d:id  = [0]
		a:end = [2, 4]       => d:end = [2]
		a:v   = [1, 2, 3, 4]    d:v   = [3, 4]
		b = 2

	Hint: use select_index():v to obtain an array without indices,
	useful for e.g. later comparing two different channels.
```

```
d = sub_mod(a, b, c)

	Does a zero-centered modulo-subtraction like '(a-b+n*c+c/2)%c-c/2':
		a:id  = [1, 2]
		a:end = [1, 2]
		a:v   = [1, 2]    d:id  = [1, 2, 3]
		b:id  = [2, 3] => d:end = [1, 2, 3]
		b:end = [1, 2]    d:v   = [1/1, (2+3)/2, 4/1]
		b:v   = [3, 4]
		c = 10

d = tot(a, b, c)

	Does time-over-threshold, 'a' = leading, 'b' = trailing, does matching
	of channels and edges.
```

```
b = tpat(a, bitmask)

	Lets values in 'a:v' with any bits marked by the bitmask pass.

		a:id  = [0]         b:id  = [0]
		a:end = [1]      => b:end = [1]
		a:v   = [0x101]     b:v   = [0x1]
		bitmask = 0x83
```

```
f = trig_map(a, b, c, d, e)

	Parses file 'a', considers lines prefixed with 'b', then does cyclical
	subtraction of trigger channels 'd', mapped by 'a', from signal
	channels 'c' with range 'e':

		a:
			Det1:1 = 1
			Det1:2 = 1
			Det1:3 = 2
			Det2:1 = 1
		b = "Det1"
		c:id  = [1, 2, 3]
		c:end = [1, 2, 3]    f:id  = [1, 2, 3]
		c:v   = [1, 2, 3] => f:end = [1, 2, 3]
		d:id  = [1, 2]       f:v   = [1-1, 2-1, 3-3]
		d:end = [1, 2]
		d:v   = [1, 3]
		e = 10
```

```
d = zero_suppress(a [, b])

	Zero-suppresses 'a:v'. 'b' is an optional cut-off which defaults to 0,
	ie all entries in 'a:v' > 'b' are pass this node:

		a:id  = [1, 2]       d:id  = [2]
		a:end = [1, 3]    => d:end = [1]
		a:v   = [0, 2, 1]    d:v   = [2]
		b = 1
```

Other functions:

```
appearance("name")

	Sets GUI style, choose one of: light, dark. The last one in the config
	will override previous invocations.
```

```
clock_match(a, b)

	Matches the computer running time to the given signal 'a', which
	should be a monotonically increasing timestamp.
	'b' is the time in seconds for the unit of 'a', eg if 'a' is in ns,
	then b=1e-9.
```

```
colormap("name")

	plutt only has "roma" built-in, which can be chosen by leaving out the
	argument, but you can use Scientific Colourmaps if that resides under
	your current working dir.

	If 'name' is eg "lajolla", the file:
		"../ScientificColourMaps7/lajolla/lajolla.lut"
	is loaded.
```

```
page("name" [, cols})

	Starts a new named page for plots. If the user did not create one
	before the first plot, a default named "Default" is made.
	The number of columns to use can optionally be specified.
```

```
ui_rate(a)

	Throttles the ImPlutt UI update rate to 'a' times per second, default
	and maximum is 20.
```


# Examples

- Plot scalar spectrum:
```
	TH1I hist...
	hist.Fill(SCALAR);

	-> hist("This be my scalar", SCALAR)
```
- Plot channel multiplicity:
```
	TH1I hist...
	hist.Fill(MULT);

	-> hist("Sup?", MULT)
```
- Plot fired channels in log scale:
```
	TH1I hist...
	canvas->cd(n)->SetLogy();
	for (i = 0; i < SUPP; ++i)
		hist.Fill(SUPPI[i]);

	-> hist("Channel map", SUPP:id, logy)
```
- Plot energy against channel with 1000 energy bins:
```
	TH2I hist...
	for (i = 0; i < SUPP; ++i)
		hist.Fill(SUPPI[i], SUPPv[i]);

	-> hist2d("Energy vs ch", SUPP:v, SUPP:id, binsy=1000)
	   hist2d("Energy vs ch", SUPP, binsy=1000)
```
- Plot multi-hit energies against channels:
```
	i = 0;
	for (j = 0; j < SUPPM; ++j) {
		ch = SUPPMI[j];
		for (; i < SUPPME[j]; ++i)
			hist->Fill(ch, SUPPv[i]);
	}

	-> hist2d("Energy vs ch", MHIT)
```
- Match two sides of a single-hit detector and draw geom mean energy:
```
	// Too much brain-wrangling code...

	-> e1, e2 = match_index(SUPP_S1E, SUPP_S2E)
	   e = mean_geom(e1, e2)
	   hist2d("Energy vs ch", e)
```
- Same with multi-hit mapping:
```
	// Even more unbearable code :o

	-> e1, e2 = match_index(MHIT_S1E, MHIT_S2E)
	   e = mean_geom(e1, e2)
	   hist2d("Energy vs ch", e)
```
- X-vs-X of two detectors:
```
	-> e11, e12 = match_index(DET1_S1E, DET1_S2E)
	   e1 = max(mean_geom(e11, e12))
	   e21, e22 = match_index(DET2_S1E, DET2_S2E)
	   e2 = max(mean_geom(e21, e22))
	   hist2d("x2 vs x1" e2:id, e1:id)
```
- ToF between two detectors:
```
	-> a1, a2 = match_index(START_S1T, START_S2T)
	   a = mean_arith(a1:v, a2:v)
	   b1, b2 = match_index(STOP_S1T, STOP_S2T)
	   b = mean_arith(b1:v, b2:v)
	   hist("ToF", sub_mod(b, a, 1000), logy)
```

Note that custom mappings can replace the value array **v** with anything. This
program allows a few other suffixes to be used instead, e.g. **E**.

Also have a look at the **sim** directory which generates some simple data and
plots them in both sensical and non-sensical ways.
